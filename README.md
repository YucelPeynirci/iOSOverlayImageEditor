# iOSOverlayImageEditor

This is an example overlay image editor app for iOS devices.

- Horizontal scroll view for overlay image options
- Selected overlay can be dragged, pinched or rotated simultaneously
- Renders the final image with overlay from screen (this part can be improved)

* Overlay assets are on a server, if assets cannot load, change it your way.
